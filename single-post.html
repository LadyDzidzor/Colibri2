           <p>For a large corporation, a small business or a solopreneur, the demands of managing the day-to-day running of your
          business can seem overwhelming. You might be hard-pressed with time, money, and human resource. You might also find
          yourself being more interested in the creative side of your business. This should not stop your business from reaching
          its visions or smashing daily, weekly or monthly goals. Outsource your business tasks to hit those goals faster because
          you cannot do it all by yourself.
          Here is a list of 10 tasks you should be outsourcing regularly:</p><br> 
          <h5>1. Bookeeping</h5> <br>
          <p>Except your company is a bookkeeping company or you are a financial guru, you might not be interested in the financial
          records that keep a business running. You can do the bookkeeping yourself but it will take your time – time you could
          have invested in other aspects of your business. There are virtual assistants with financial skill sets. You can
          contract this to them and they will take care of all your messy financial work.</p> <br>
          <h5>2. Email Management</h5> <br>
          <p>Email management
          Everyone hates the boring monotonous routine of “best regards” and “find attached”, and the frustrating ordeal of
          scanning through thousands of emails and prioritizing which to reply to and how to reply to each of them. Why do you
          keep on doing this when it is not saving you any time or money? According to a study by Adobe, on average, you can spend
          six (6) hours a day doing this. Outsourcing the task of email management would help you regain the time you lose each
          day.</p> <br>
          <h5>3. Customer Feedback</h5><br>
          <p>The customer is always right. Therefore, it is important to factor customer feedback into your business model. However,
          you don’t have to do it yourself especially if you have a large customer base. It would leave you no room to act on that
          feedback. You can outsource this task to a virtual assistant who can respond and forward the concerns of your customers.
          Your business will thank you for this when you outsource it.</p><br>
          <h5>4. Travel Management</h5><br>
          <p>Every now and then, you might need to travel for both business and personal purposes. The choice of a means of travel
          and other decisions like accommodation, food, guide, etc. can be overwhelming and can take a significant part of your
          time. Let a virtual assistant handle it for you.</p><br>
          <h5>5. Data Entry</h5><br>
          <p>If you run a project and need to store a large amount of data, it would be very useful to let someone else enter that
          data on your behalf. Virtual assistants can help you do that conveniently, helping you speed up the completion of your
          projects.</p> <br>
          <h5>6. Schedule and Calendar management</h5><br>
          <p>Someone has to book appointments and cancel them. If your business model relies on face-to-face or virtual meetings, you
          would easily lose yourself trying to catch up with the number, date and time of appointments. You can outsource this to
          a virtual assistant and free up your mind for what to say at your meetings!</p><br>

            </figure>
            <h5>7. Database management</h5><br>
            <p>Except you are a database manager, you might be better off managing your time by allowing a virtual assistant manage
            your database while freeing up your time for more productive work. Even if you were a database manager, you would still
            need some help in managing several databases. A virtual assistant can help you do this effectively.</p><br>
            <h5>8. Digital marketing</h5><br>
            <p> Digital content is what drives businesses online. Digital marketing is broad and can range from Search Engine
            Optimization (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (SEM), paid social media advertising, influencer marketing, content
            marketing and a wide range of others. Each of these would need an expert and you cannot do all by yourself. Outsource
            them.</p><br>
            <h5>9. Managing websites</h5><br>
              <p>There is so much involved when it comes to managing your business website or your personal website. From building the
              website to managing the content on it and renewing domain and hosting plans, you can get frustrated or overwhelmed. This
              is the reason you should outsource this.</p><br>
             <h5>10. Content formatting and editing</h5><br>
                <p>Business managers and solopreneurs are mostly perfectionists and like to manage their work by themselves but having a
                fresh eye go over your written work to provide proper edits is always better. By outsourcing this task, you would be
                able to catch errors that your eyes must have skipped when you have a different person helping you with content editing
                and formatting.</p><br>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2><br>
                <p>Knowing when to seek help and when to let go is a skill you can cultivate. Outsourcing your tasks is one of the best
                ways to seek help and let go of the tasks you should be outsourcing regularly. If you do not know what some of these
                tasks are, we have highlighted ten (10) for you here and we hope they will give you a clue into the others you should be
                outsourcing too.

                outsource your tasks to, you can contact Colibri to help you.
